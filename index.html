Class Player based on 2 LinkedLists for playlist and for albums storage. ListIterator was used to move through the playlist. User is asked to provide action choices in an infinite loop. Various actions (20) are available, related to adding songs/albums (e.g. creating albums, adding specific songs or whole albums to the playlist), "playing" the playlist (all the playlist from the beginning or a specific song chosen by a track number, playing the last played song, the next and/or previous song), printing songs in playlist, songs in a specific album or in all albums (several types of print available), searching for specific songs in playlist and/or in stored albums. You can also search for a specific song in all the album store in case you suspect a given song might have re-occurred in 1 or more albums. Inner class PairNumberSong was created to identify the number of the album and the position number in a given album when searching for one song in more than one album. You can delete a song from playlist by its title or by its track number. The code is guarded from repeating playing the same song when changing the direction of traversal through the playlist, also from the attempt to move outside of the range of the playlist when any of its ends is reached or from entering a non-numeric value as a track choice; also from duplicating albums in  the album store. Separate method songNumberChoice() was used to properly process user's choice of the song number. Constituent package private classes Song and Album were used to build a main class Player. JAR archive was created. Object class toString() was overriden.</span><span class="expand-collapse">Read more</span></p>

				<a href="https://github.com/maciej-mazur-github/JAVA_Paint-Job-Problem" target="_blank">Paint Job Problem</a>
				<p class="project-description">Resolution to an interesting algorithmic problem described extensively as follows:<br>

					"Bob is a wall painter<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> and he needs your help. You have to write a program that helps Bob calculate how many buckets of paint he needs to buy before going to work. Bob might also have some extra buckets at home. He also knows the area that he can cover with one bucket of paint.<br><br>

				1. Write a method named getBucketCount with 4 parameters. The first parameter should be named width of type double. This parameter represents the width of the wall.
				The second parameter should be named height of type double. This parameter represents the height of the wall.
				The third parameter should be named areaPerBucket. This parameter represents the area that can be covered with one bucket of paint.
				The fourth parameter should be named extraBuckets. This parameter represents the bucket count that Bob has at home.
				The method needs to return a value of type int that represents the number of buckets that Bob needs to buy before going to work. To calculate the bucket count, refer to the notes below.
				If one of the parameters width, height or areaPerBucket is less or equal to 0 or if extraBuckets is less than 0, the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
				If all parameters are valid, the method needs to calculate the number of buckets and return it.<br><br>

				Examples of input/output: <br>
					getBucketCount(-3.4, 2.1, 1.5, 2); → should return -1 since the width parameter is invalid<br>
					getBucketCount(3.4, 2.1, 1.5, 2); → should return 3 since the wall area is 7.14, a single bucket can cover an area of 1.5 and Bob has 2 extra buckets home.<br>
					getBucketCount(2.75, 3.25, 2.5, 1); → should return 3 since the wall area is 8.9375, a single bucket can cover an area of 2.5 and Bob has 1 extra bucket at home.<br><br>

				2. Bob does not like to enter 0 for the extraBuckets parameter so he needs another method.
				Write another overloaded method named getBucketCount with 3 parameters namely width, height, and areaPerBucket (all of type double).
				This method needs to return a value of type int that represents the number of buckets that Bob needs to buy before going to work. To calculate the bucket count, refer to the notes below.
				If one of the parameters width, height or areaPerBucket is less or equal to 0, the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
				If all parameters are valid, the method needs to calculate the number of buckets and return it.<br><br>

				Examples of input/output: <br>
					getBucketCount(-3.4, 2.1, 1.5); → should return -1 since the width parameter is invalid<br>
					getBucketCount(3.4, 2.1, 1.5); → should return 5 since the wall area is 7.14, and a single bucket can cover an area of 1.5.<br>
					getBucketCount(7.25, 4.3, 2.35); → should return 14 since the wall area is 31.175, and a single bucket can cover an area of 2.35.<br><br>

				3. In some cases, Bob does not know the width and height of the wall but he knows the area of a wall. He needs you to write another method.
				Write another overloaded method named getBucketCount with 2 parameters namely, area and areaPerBucket (both of type double).
				The method needs to return a value of type int that represents the number of buckets that Bob needs to buy before going to work. To calculate the bucket count, refer to the notes below.
				If one of the parameters area or areaPerBucket is less or equal to 0, the method needs to return -1to indicate an invalid value.
				If all parameters are valid, the method needs to calculate the number of buckets and return it.<br><br>

				Examples of input/output: <br>
					getBucketCount(3.4, 1.5); → should return 3 since the area is 3.4 and a single bucket can cover an area of 1.5<br>
					getBucketCount(6.26, 2.2); → should return 3 since the wall area is 6.26 and a single bucket can cover an area of 2.2.<br>
					getBucketCount(3.26, 0.75); → should return 5 since the wall area is 3.26, and a single bucket can cover an area of 0.75 .<br><br>

				Do your best to help Bob"

You can add items using either a recursive or<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> non-recursive method. In both cases you are restricted from adding an existing item. The removal of the item is only available in a recursive form. All scenarios of removal are covered - when a found and to-be-removed item has no subtree whatsoever, when it has only the left subtree, when it only has a right subtree and finally when it has both left and right subtrees. In the latter scenario finding the smallest value item in the right subtree has been used to re-build the current structure of the tree. The code is guarded from the attempt to remove a non-existent item. You can also check whether a given item already exists in the BST or not, using recursive method. Variables foundSearchedItem and lastFoundItem have been used to let all the methods use them any time. Traversing the list is available in 3 ways:<br><br>

					1. Recursively.<br>
					2. Using Stack and no recursion.<br>

				<p class="project-description">Pretty creative and optimized approach to resolving the Flour Pack Problem quoted below<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">:<br><br>
				"Write a method named canPack with three parameters of type int named bigCount, smallCount, and goal.<br>
				The parameter bigCount represents the count of big flour bags (5 kilos each). The parameter smallCount represents the count of small flour bags (1 kilo each). The parameter goal represents the goal amount of kilos of flour needed to assemble a package. Therefore, the sum of the kilos of bigCount and smallCount must be at least equal to the value of goal. The method should return true if it is possible to make a package with goal kilos of flour. If the sum is greater than goal, ensure that only full bags are used towards the goal amount. <br><br>
				For example, if goal = 9, bigCount = 2, and smallCount = 0, the method should return false since each big bag is 5 kilos and cannot be divided. However, if goal = 9, bigCount = 1, and smallCount = 5, the method should return true because of 1 full bigCount bag and 4 full smallCount bags equal goal, and it's okay if there are additional bags left over.<br><br>

				<a href="https://github.com/maciej-mazur-github/JAVA_Paint-Job-Problem" target="_blank">Paint Job Problem</a>
				<p class="project-description">Resolution to an interesting algorithmic problem described extensively as follows:<br>

					"Bob is a wall painter<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> and he needs your help. You have to write a program that helps Bob calculate how many buckets of paint he needs to buy before going to work. Bob might also have some extra buckets at home. He also knows the area that he can cover with one bucket of paint.<br><br>

				1. Write a method named getBucketCount with 4 parameters. The first parameter should be named width of type double. This parameter represents the width of the wall.
				The second parameter should be named height of type double. This parameter represents the height of the wall.
				The third parameter should be named areaPerBucket. This parameter represents the area that can be covered with one bucket of paint.
				The fourth parameter should be named extraBuckets. This parameter represents the bucket count that Bob has at home.
				The method needs to return a value of type int that represents the number of buckets that Bob needs to buy before going to work. To calculate the bucket count, refer to the notes below.
				If one of the parameters width, height or areaPerBucket is less or equal to 0 or if extraBuckets is less than 0, the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
				If all parameters are valid, the method needs to calculate the number of buckets and return it.<br><br>

				Examples of input/output: <br>
					getBucketCount(-3.4, 2.1, 1.5, 2); → should return -1 since the width parameter is invalid<br>
					getBucketCount(3.4, 2.1, 1.5, 2); → should return 3 since the wall area is 7.14, a single bucket can cover an area of 1.5 and Bob has 2 extra buckets home.<br>
					getBucketCount(2.75, 3.25, 2.5, 1); → should return 3 since the wall area is 8.9375, a single bucket can cover an area of 2.5 and Bob has 1 extra bucket at home.<br><br>

				2. Bob does not like to enter 0 for the extraBuckets parameter so he needs another method.
				Write another overloaded method named getBucketCount with 3 parameters namely width, height, and areaPerBucket (all of type double).
				This method needs to return a value of type int that represents the number of buckets that Bob needs to buy before going to work. To calculate the bucket count, refer to the notes below.
				If one of the parameters width, height or areaPerBucket is less or equal to 0, the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
				If all parameters are valid, the method needs to calculate the number of buckets and return it.<br><br>

				Examples of input/output: <br>
					getBucketCount(-3.4, 2.1, 1.5); → should return -1 since the width parameter is invalid<br>
					getBucketCount(3.4, 2.1, 1.5); → should return 5 since the wall area is 7.14, and a single bucket can cover an area of 1.5.<br>
					getBucketCount(7.25, 4.3, 2.35); → should return 14 since the wall area is 31.175, and a single bucket can cover an area of 2.35.<br><br>

				3. In some cases, Bob does not know the width and height of the wall but he knows the area of a wall. He needs you to write another method.
				Write another overloaded method named getBucketCount with 2 parameters namely, area and areaPerBucket (both of type double).
				The method needs to return a value of type int that represents the number of buckets that Bob needs to buy before going to work. To calculate the bucket count, refer to the notes below.
				If one of the parameters area or areaPerBucket is less or equal to 0, the method needs to return -1to indicate an invalid value.
				If all parameters are valid, the method needs to calculate the number of buckets and return it.<br><br>

				Examples of input/output: <br>
					getBucketCount(3.4, 1.5); → should return 3 since the area is 3.4 and a single bucket can cover an area of 1.5<br>
					getBucketCount(6.26, 2.2); → should return 3 since the wall area is 6.26 and a single bucket can cover an area of 2.2.<br>
					getBucketCount(3.26, 0.75); → should return 5 since the wall area is 3.26, and a single bucket can cover an area of 0.75 .<br><br>

				Do your best to help Bob"
