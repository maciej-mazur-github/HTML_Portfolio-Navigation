There is an immutable class Location of which each object contains its own<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> HashMap with exits, mapping direction string IDs (S, N, W, E and Q) with their corresponding locationID numbers, e.g., if you are currently in the location #1 and if you choose to go North, then you will reach the location #5 (please see the attached .png file in the repository). There is also another class used, AdventureGame, that contains 2 other HashMaps – ‘locations’ and ‘directionsVocabulary’. HashMap "locations" contains a mapping between each location's integer ID and the corresponding object of class Location (the latter one basically binding information on given location's possible exit IDs and to which locations these exits lead). HashMap ‘directionsVocabulary’ plays a role of mapping keywords representing directions of the world (SOUTH, NORTH etc.) with their 1-character IDs (S, N etc.). The usage of toUpperCase() and splitting user's string input (when asked in which direction they want to go) allows the program to properly process not only short, case-sensitive answers like S, N, but also the answers like "I now need to go south" (as this answer contains the keyword "south"). Both HashMaps 'locations' and 'directionsVocabulary' are fully initialized by AdventureGame's constructor. Each location in 'locations' HashMap contains Q->0 mapping which allows the user to break program's main infinite loop and hence to end the program whenever 'Q' or the keyword 'quit' is entered.</span><span class="expand-collapse">Read more</span></p>

The inner class Seat is used that implements Comparable interface and overrides its compareTo() method<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">, later used by Collections.binarySearch(). The row number and seats per row number are both set up in a constructor call. Also, the constructor creates all the seats in 'seats' ArrayList in ascending order (by seat number, which actually is a String e.g. H05, A12, E09 etc.), setting their prices as 7$, 12$ or 14$ according to their location relative to the margins (being ¼ of row count and seat per row count respectively). You can also sort all the seats by price order. In that case the interface Comparator variable is used and an anonymous class to override compare() method, then Collections.sort() method is used. You can also shuffle all the seats with a method based on Collections.shuffle() and then, if you prefer, sort them all again by name in ascending order using a method based on Selection Sort algorithm. You can show all the seats, including their number, price and reservation status. Method showSeats() uses a String 'builder' to construct a desired presentation. When reserving a seat, the validity of the number entered by the user is verified first. Lower case letters are replaced with uppercase and 1-digit seat numbers (in a row) have leading zero added. Then, if the ArrayList is sorted by seat number in ascending order, 3 types of searching the desired seat are available - Brute Force, Binary Search (based on Collections.binarySearch()) and manually implemented Binary Search. Brute Force and manually implemented Binary Search also print dots to let the user be aware of the time complexity of both algorithms. You can also cancel the reservation of any seat. The only public method run() is based on an infinite loop that can be broken only by choosing zero by the user.</span><span class="expand-collapse">Read more</span></p>

The removal of the item is only available in a recursive form. All scenarios of removal are covered - when a found and to-be-removed item has no subtree whatsoever, when it has only the left subtree, when it only has a right subtree and finally when it has both left and right subtrees. In the latter scenario finding the smallest value item in the right subtree has been used to re-build the current structure of the tree. The code is guarded from the attempt to remove a non-existent item. You can also check whether a given item already exists in the BST or not, using recursive method. Variables foundSearchedItem and lastFoundItem have been used to let all the methods use them any time. Traversing the list is available in 3 ways:<br><br>

                    "Write a method named canPack with three parameters of type int named bigCount, smallCount, and goal.<br>
                    The parameter bigCount represents the count of big flour bags (5 kilos each). The parameter smallCount represents the count of small flour bags (1 kilo each). The parameter goal represents the goal amount of kilos of flour needed to assemble a package. Therefore, the sum of the kilos of bigCount and smallCount must be at least equal to the value of goal. The method should return true if it is possible to make a package with goal kilos of flour. If the sum is greater than goal, ensure that only full bags are used towards the goal amount. <br><br>
                    For example, if goal = 9, bigCount = 2, and smallCount = 0, the method should return false since each big bag is 5 kilos and cannot be divided. However, if goal = 9, bigCount = 1, and smallCount = 5, the method should return true because of 1 full bigCount bag and 4 full smallCount bags equal goal, and it's okay if there are additional bags left over.<br><br>

                    <p class="project-description">Resolution to an interesting algorithmic problem described extensively as follows:<br>

                        "Bob is a wall painter<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> and he needs your help. You have to write a program that helps Bob calculate how many buckets of paint he needs to buy before going to work. Bob might also have some extra buckets at home. He also knows the area that he can cover with one bucket of paint.<br><br>

                    1. Write a method named getBucketCount with 4 parameters. The first parameter should be named width of type double. This parameter represents the width of the wall.
                    The second parameter should be named height of type double. This parameter represents the height of the wall.
                    The third parameter should be named areaPerBucket. This parameter represents the area that can be covered with one bucket of paint.
                    The fourth parameter should be named extraBuckets. This parameter represents the bucket count that Bob has at home.
                    The method needs to return a value of type int that represents the number of buckets that Bob needs to buy before going to work. To calculate the bucket count, refer to the notes below.
                    If one of the parameters width, height or areaPerBucket is less or equal to 0 or if extraBuckets is less than 0, the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
                    If all parameters are valid, the method needs to calculate the number of buckets and return it.<br><br>

                    Examples of input/output: <br>
                        getBucketCount(-3.4, 2.1, 1.5, 2); → should return -1 since the width parameter is invalid<br>
                        getBucketCount(3.4, 2.1, 1.5, 2); → should return 3 since the wall area is 7.14, a single bucket can cover an area of 1.5 and Bob has 2 extra buckets home.<br>
                        getBucketCount(2.75, 3.25, 2.5, 1); → should return 3 since the wall area is 8.9375, a single bucket can cover an area of 2.5 and Bob has 1 extra bucket at home.<br><br>

                    2. Bob does not like to enter 0 for the extraBuckets parameter so he needs another method.
                    Write another overloaded method named getBucketCount with 3 parameters namely width, height, and areaPerBucket (all of type double).
                    This method needs to return a value of type int that represents the number of buckets that Bob needs to buy before going to work. To calculate the bucket count, refer to the notes below.
                    If one of the parameters width, height or areaPerBucket is less or equal to 0, the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
                    If all parameters are valid, the method needs to calculate the number of buckets and return it.<br><br>

                    Examples of input/output: <br>
                        getBucketCount(-3.4, 2.1, 1.5); → should return -1 since the width parameter is invalid<br>
                        getBucketCount(3.4, 2.1, 1.5); → should return 5 since the wall area is 7.14, and a single bucket can cover an area of 1.5.<br>
                        getBucketCount(7.25, 4.3, 2.35); → should return 14 since the wall area is 31.175, and a single bucket can cover an area of 2.35.<br><br>

                    3. In some cases, Bob does not know the width and height of the wall but he knows the area of a wall. He needs you to write another method.
                    Write another overloaded method named getBucketCount with 2 parameters namely, area and areaPerBucket (both of type double).
                    The method needs to return a value of type int that represents the number of buckets that Bob needs to buy before going to work. To calculate the bucket count, refer to the notes below.
                    If one of the parameters area or areaPerBucket is less or equal to 0, the method needs to return -1to indicate an invalid value.
                    If all parameters are valid, the method needs to calculate the number of buckets and return it.<br><br>

                    Examples of input/output: <br>
                        getBucketCount(3.4, 1.5); → should return 3 since the area is 3.4 and a single bucket can cover an area of 1.5<br>
                        getBucketCount(6.26, 2.2); → should return 3 since the wall area is 6.26 and a single bucket can cover an area of 2.2.<br>
                        getBucketCount(3.26, 0.75); → should return 5 since the wall area is 3.26, and a single bucket can cover an area of 0.75 .<br><br>
